## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.
```swift
var color: [String] = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise","lavender"]
print("\(color[0]), \(color[2]) and \(color[3]) are some of my favorite colors")

```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.
```swift
var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]
westernStates.remove(at: 5)
westernStates.remove(at: 4)
print(westernStates)

```
## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

```swift
let moreStates: [String] = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]

for i in moreStates {
if i != moreStates[0] && i != moreStates[2]{
print("\(i): continental United States")
} else {
print("\(i): not continental United States")
}
}
```

## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`
```swift
let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"
var whiteSpace = 0
for i in myString {
if i != " "{
whiteSpace += 1
}
}
print(whiteSpace)
```

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`
```swift
var whiteSpace = 0
var counter = 0
let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]
for i in myFavoriteQuotes {
for a in myFavoriteQuotes[counter]{
if a != " "{
whiteSpace += 1
}

}
counter += 1
print("the line \(i) has a total of \(whiteSpace) non-whitespace characters  " )
whiteSpace = 0
}
print(whiteSpace)

```

## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
var counter = 0
for i in garden {
if i == String("\u{0001f337}"){
garden[counter] = "dirt"
basket.append("\u{0001f337}")
}
counter+=1
}
print("Garden array: \(garden)")
print("Basket array: \(basket) has a total of \(basket.count) flowers")



```

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`
```swift
var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]
var counter = 0
for i in battingLineup {
if i == "Jeter"{
print(i)
battingLineup[counter] = "Tejada"
}
if i == "Thomas" {
battingLineup[counter] = "Guerrero"

}
counter += 1

}
battingLineup.append("Suzuki")
battingLineup.swapAt(0, 7)
print(battingLineup)
```

## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```
```
var numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]
var some = false
let target: Int = 32
for i in numbers {
if i == target {
some = true
}
}
print(some)


```

## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.

let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var greatest = -1000
for i in arrayOfNumbers {
if i > greatest {
greatest = i
}
}
print(arrayOfNumbers)
print(greatest)




```


## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.


let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var smallest = 1000
for i in arrayOfNumbers {
if i < smallest {
smallest = i
}
}
print(arrayOfNumbers)
print(smallest)

```


## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`
```swift
var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]
for i in secondListOfNumbers {
if i%2  != 0{
print(i)
}
}

```

## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
```swift
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var sum = 0
for i in thirdListOfNumbers {
sum += i
}
print(sum)

```

## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
```swift
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var sum = 0
for i in thirdListOfNumbers {
if i % 2 == 0{
sum += i
}}
print(sum)

```

## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
for i in listOne {
for b in listTwo {
if i == b {
sharedElements.append(b)
}
}
}
print(sharedElements)

```


## Question 14

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
for i in dupeFriendlyList {
if !noDupeList.contains(i){
noDupeList.append(i)
}
}
print(noDupeList)
```

## Question 15

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`
```swift

let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var small = Int.max
var secSmall = Int.max

for i in arrayOfNumbers {
if i < small {
small = i //
}
}

for i in arrayOfNumbers {
if i < secSmall && i != small {
secSmall = i
}
}
print(secSmall)

```

## Question 16
